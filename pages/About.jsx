            <p>
                I’m a frontend developer with a passion for building clean and accessible user interfaces.
                I enjoy learning new technologies and turning ideas into real products.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main tools are React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — but I’m also exploring backend development and cloud tools.
