                <p>
                    I’m a frontend developer passionate about clean design and great user experiences.
                    I focus on building responsive websites using modern tools like React and Vite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love solving real-world problems through code, and I’m always learning new things to improve my skills.
                    Currently, I'm exploring backend development and cloud services as well.
